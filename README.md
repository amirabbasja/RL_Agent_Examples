# Examples of reinforcement learning agents

I have used gymnasium in this repo. Some examples of various environments of gymnasium are available here. I have used DQN (Deep Q Networks) for training the agents. Also, its worthy to note that the code is implemented in both Tensorflow 2.0 and Pytorch.

Regards.
